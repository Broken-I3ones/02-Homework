# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

This Homework was a bit harder but i still enjoyed it. I struggle with the git commands still and I need to learn more on how to make a hidden text box appear when clicked on/ hovered over as well as making a herf work so that when clicked on it will scroll down the website to the designated location.
I also cant seem to get the website up i need to learn m,ore on making a working website from scratch and be able to upload it.
